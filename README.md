# odin-recipes
recipe assignment from the odin project curriculum

notes pre-project, 1/23/22 @ 3:28 pm.
the task ahead of me, for this project, is to demonstrate what i've learned so far. 
- things like git and html basics. 
in particular creating a cohesive website with pages that are easily navigable, organized, and clean. it will look rough, sure, but style is for another time. my goal is to demonstrate good habits with commits and the git workflow and readable / understandable / usable code. i will do a refresher of that lesson before i begin, but i am feeling good about this. / rowenne
