   <h3>The perfect follow up to dinner on cheat day.</h2>
   <p>It's a timeless flavor combination in the form of a shake. Made with chocolate chip icecream and frozen strawberries, it couldn't get any easier.
   </p>
   <h2> Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
       <li> 1 1/2 cups chocolate chip icecream (private select from kroger is my go-to.)</li>
       <li> 1/2 cups frozen strawberries</li>
       <li> Blender 
   </ul>
   <br>
   <h2> Steps</h2>
   <ol>
       <li> Assemble blender (make sure the blades in) </li>
       <li> Scoop icecream into pitcher</li>
       <li> Toss those strawberries in with whatever else you want</li>
       <li> Secure lid, then blend. Go nuts.</li>
       <li> Open blender and scoop carefully into desired eating apparatus with spoon or spatula. Clear blades midway, then continue dispensing. </li> 
       <li> Rinse your blender and blades thoroughly (do future you a favor)</li> 
       <li> Enjoy your icecream shake guilt free because you probably really want it. Straw and spoon, my friend. Straw and spoon.</li>
