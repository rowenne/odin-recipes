   <h3>This Korean-inspired pork stew is a quick and easy weeknight choice.</h2>
   <p>It's a <em>one pot dish </em>that easily pairs with rice, 
       the <em> <strong> potato and pork </strong></em>pick up the robust flavor
       of <strong><em>red pepper paste </em></strong> and the onions give it nice body. 
       It takes less than an hour to make and takes well to customization.
   </p>
   <h2> Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
       <li> 1/2lbs diced or chopped pork</li>
       <li> 4 cups water</li>
       <li> 1/2lbs choped onion </li>
       <li> 1 tbsps minced garlic</li>
       <li> 1/8 cups flavorless cooking oil</li>
       <li> 1 tbsp of Gochujaru or Red Pepper Flakes</li>
       <li> 1/2lbs chopped full-size potatoes <em> or whole small ones</em></li>
       <li> 1/3 cups gochujang</li>
       <li> 1/4 cups miso paste</li>
       <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
       <li> cooked white rice, optional.</li>
   </ul>
   <br>
   <h2> Steps</h2>
   <ol>
       <li> Over medium heat, coat bottom of large size pot with cooking oil. </li>
       <li> Season pork with salt and pepper then add the meat to your pot to begin browning. If you chose fatty pork, the goal is to let that fat render and create a nice frond on the bottom of the pot.</li>
       <li> Once pork is browned, deglaze pot with water. Bring the 4 cups of water to a boil. You may need more or less water depending on your pot. The next step is adding potatoes.</li>
       <li> As the water comes to a boil it may foam over. Scoop away and dispose of some of this. </li>
       <li> Now that your water is boiling, add potatoes and gochujang and miso paste to your pot. Let it rumble over medium heat for 30 minutes.</li>
       <li> Check potatoes periodically for doneness. When they are 3/4 cooked through, add the chopped onion, garlic, and gochujaru or sichuan flakes. Boil additional 20 minutes. </li>
       <li> Taste carefully (obviously it's piping hot). Make last minute preference adjustments. Then serve and garnish with chopped scallion. I prefer serving directly over white rice.</li>
